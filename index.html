            <p>So this is the place you may be reading here, I am a normal student from <b>UPES Btech CSE 2021-25</b>. I am someone having adrenaline to show what I could in this world, by making an identity of my own, OR at least trying the same...... This undergoes a few ascepts I would love to share about myself, Hope you find them intresting to look upon. <i>As to my strengths</i>, I am hungry for knowledge, finishing up the task provided to me in the given time frame, a few social skills. I enjoy spending time with my friends , 
                listening to music , read or watch something, in my free time. Below are a few key qualities in me: </p>

                <div class="column">
                    <h3>CONSISTENT</h3>
                    <p>I think I am a consistent, once I start up a task I always try to finish it in one sitting only. This could be advantageous and a flaw sometimes too, but I see it as a perk in me. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h3>HELPFUL</h3>
                    <p>I try to help someone in whatever way I can, also keeping in mind about how that resource be used by someone, I try to give them what they want. If in a condition of unable to help someone, I always try some soothing words which can atleast reduce there tense behaviour towards it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h3>PLANNER</h3>
                    <p>I woudld say I am the type of person who schedules his/her daily work-flow and goes over the plan. No matter how big or small condition is I always plan over the key factors, or resource I have and come up to its solution accordingly.</p>
